//1. Compile a list of all persons, places, languages etc.
2. Count the number of periodicals/rows in the table that contain the indexed term
3. Compile a list of periodical/row IDs identifying the periodicals/rows that contain the indexed term in order to construct links from the index to the source//

4. Match the indexed terms against authority files, such as a gazetteer, for disambiguation and enriching the data with, for instance, geolocations. This step is currently only relevant for mapping. You cannot rely on automatic geocoding upon runtime in the browser as all services are biased towards the Global North and the US. Even Naples will commonly be located in the US instead of Italy.
